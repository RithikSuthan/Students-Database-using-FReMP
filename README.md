# Students Database using FReMP

Welcome to the Students Database project implemented using FReMP (Flask, React, MongoDB, and Python)!

## Overview

This project is a web application designed to manage student data efficiently using a modern tech stack. It utilizes Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage.

## Features

- **Student Management:** Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records.
- **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for specific students and filter them based on various criteria.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure login functionality ensures only authorized users can access and modify student data.
- **Responsive Design:** Responsive UI ensures seamless user experience across all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** Backend framework for building web applications with Python.
- **React:** Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing and managing student data efficiently.
- **Python:** Programming language used for backend development.
