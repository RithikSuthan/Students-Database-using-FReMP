# Students-Database-using-FReMP

A basic student management system was developed using React JS for the front end, and the student details were stored in the backend using MongoDB Atlas Cloud. Flask API was used for the requests, and Python was used for the backend connection. The admin must sign up or sign in to the application before dealing with the student's application.
